## Simple upload server example

This is pretty much ripped from  the [multiparty examples](https://github.com/andrewrk/node-multiparty). This will receive a file in the upload_files directory automatically and send over an html form if you're hitting the root endpoint.

## USAGE
`node server.js --harmony`

## TEST
Use the included `test_upload.sh` to send a curl request to your localhost. (Hacky but oh well.)
